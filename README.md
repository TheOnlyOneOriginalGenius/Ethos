Project Vision
ETHOS was forged with one uncompromising purpose: eliminate the chaos of hidden clauses, scattered data, and disconnected user experiences. Our multi-API approach—REST (with PostgreSQL) and GraphQL (with MongoDB)—unlocks limitless potential for dynamic interactions, bridging the gap between dreamers, doers, and decision-makers everywhere.

With ETHOS, you can:

Shred Complexity: Instantly transform monstrous documents into crystal-clear insights.
Unify Operations: Harness the synergy of both RESTful and GraphQL paradigms for maximum flexibility.
Seize Tomorrow: Whether you’re an indie developer, an enterprise powerhouse, or an ambitious disruptor, ETHOS brings unbreakable clarity to your app ecosystem.
Tech Stack & Key Technologies
Frontend:

React for a blazing-fast user interface.
Modern JavaScript (ES6+) and optional libraries like Axios, Redux, or Material-UI.
Backend:

Node.js + Express.js as the foundational server framework.
Two Database Approaches:
PostgreSQL + Sequelize (RESTful API)
MongoDB + Mongoose (GraphQL API)
JWT for user authentication and secure sessions.
Cloud & Deployment:

Render for seamless, data-driven deployment.
GitHub Actions for robust, automatic CI/CD workflows.
Other Essentials:

dotenv for environment variable management.
ESLint, Prettier for consistent coding standards.
Features & Highlights
Dual-API Glory

REST endpoints for lightning-fast, conventional CRUD operations.
GraphQL queries & mutations for flexible data retrieval, minimal overfetching, and unstoppable developer delight.
Adaptive Databases

PostgreSQL (via Sequelize): Structured data, robust relationships, endless reliability.
MongoDB (via Mongoose): Rapid iteration, dynamic schemas, perfect synergy with GraphQL.
JWT Authentication

Keep your data safe behind industry-standard JSON Web Tokens.
Implement user sign-ups, logins, and auto-protected routes with minimal overhead.
Responsive, Polished UI

Built in React for a sleek, interactive front end.
Dynamically fetch and display data from both REST and GraphQL APIs.
Render Deployment

Simplified cloud hosting.
Automatic Git-based deployments and environment variable configuration.
CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Continuous integration ensures pristine code quality.
Automatic tests, builds, and deployments—no more manual drudgery.

Local Installation & Setup
Clone the Repo

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ETHOS.git
cd ETHOS
Install Dependencies

Frontend
bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install
Backend
bash
Copy code
cd ../server
npm install
Start Services

Backend
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Frontend
bash
Copy code
cd ../client
npm start
By default, the backend might run on http://localhost:3001 and the React frontend on http://localhost:3000.

Databases

PostgreSQL: Ensure a local Postgres instance is running.
MongoDB: Ensure your local MongoDB server (mongod) is up, or use a cloud service like Atlas.
Environment Variables
Use dotenv to protect sensitive info:

server/.env (example):

makefile
Copy code
PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET="UltraSecretString"
POSTGRES_URI="postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/ethos_db"
MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/ethos_db"
client/.env (optional for API endpoints):

makefile
Copy code
REACT_APP_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3001"
Always add .env to .gitignore to avoid committing secrets.

Usage & Commands
Server

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm run dev       # Development (e.g., nodemon)
npm run start     # Production
Client

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm start         # Runs the React dev server
npm run build     # Creates a production build
Database Sync (PostgreSQL)
You might have a script that syncs Sequelize models:

js
Copy code
// e.g., in server.js
await sequelize.sync({ force: false });
Adjust as needed to create or drop tables.

GraphQL Queries/Mutations

Access via POST /graphql or the Apollo/GraphiQL Playground if enabled.
Deployment: Render
Create a Web Service for your server:

Link your GitHub repo.
Set environment variables (JWT_SECRET, POSTGRES_URI, MONGO_URI) in Render’s dashboard.
Create a Static Site for your React build (or serve the build from the Express server):

If static hosting: Deploy the client folder’s build output.
If integrated: Use app.use(express.static('./client/build')) in your server.
Configure any Dockerfile or render.yaml in /deploy/render/ if you’re containerizing.

When you push to main (or your deployment branch), Render automatically triggers a build and redeploy.
